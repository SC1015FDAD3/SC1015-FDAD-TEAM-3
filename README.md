# TikTok Music Popularity Analysis üéµ

## Project Overview üåü
This project explores the factors driving track popularity on TikTok, focusing on musical qualities, clustering analysis, and statistical validation. It aims to uncover the key elements contributing to a song's virality on TikTok, emphasising that star power is not always necessary for success.

## Methodology ‚öôÔ∏è
The project employs a comprehensive approach, integrating several key analyses to reach its conclusions:

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- This step provides a preliminary examination of the dataset, identifying significant correlations and patterns. The analysis revealed a notable correlation between "artist_pop" and "track_pop," suggesting that artist popularity has a global impact on track success.


### Machine Learning 

We split our machine learning analysis into two parts:


- **Part 1: Feature Analysis with Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression, Lasso Regression, H2O AutoML**: Helped identify the most significant predictors of track popularity. Confirmed that "artist_pop" is the most significant factor affecting "track_pop" globally. 

- **Part 2: Clustering Analysis**: K-Means clustering grouped songs based on musical qualities. The Elbow method helped determine the optimal number of clusters, suggesting a 3- or 4-cluster setup as optimal for further analysis. This addressed a more TikTok-specific focus. Since 'track_pop' reflects global popularity but doesn't necessarily indicate TikTok virality, we turned to clustering to find patterns in the musical qualities of songs that went viral on TikTok. This helped us uncover the attributes that make a song a TikTok sensation.

Our dual-analysis strategy provides a thorough understanding of what makes a song go viral on TikTok. It's a valuable resource for stakeholders, especially those with limited budgets, as it demonstrates how music can achieve popularity based on its intrinsic qualities. This approach is perfect for designing effective campaigns and managing resources, particularly when working within budget constraints or without the involvement of major artists

- **T-Test Validation**: T-tests were used to assess the statistical significance of differences between clusters. This validation step confirms the distinctiveness of certain clusters and identifies key differentiators.


## Key Insights üîç
The project identifies several factors contributing to TikTok virality:

- **Energy and Loudness**: Tracks with high energy and loudness are more likely to capture attention on TikTok.
- **Danceability and Valence**: High danceability and positive sentiment in tracks align with the platform's dynamic and engaging content.

## Conclusion ‚ú®
While traditional music platforms rely heavily on artist popularity, TikTok offers a level playing field where creativity, energy, and rhythm matter most. This project demonstrates that tracks can go viral on TikTok without relying solely on star power, highlighting the importance of unique musical qualities.

## Future Directions üöÄ
The project plans to explore advanced feature engineering with text analysis of lyrics, focusing on the relationship between lyrical content and musical elements. By combining musical and textual analysis, the project aims to provide a more comprehensive understanding of what drives song virality on TikTok.
